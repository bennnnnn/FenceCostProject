Prompt user to enter  fence length.
  Read length
Prompt user to enter  fence width.
 Read width
Calculate fence perimeter (perimeter= 2*(length +width))
Prompt user to choose fence type.
       if fence type is wooden 
                 fenceOnlyCost = 25 *perimeter
    else if  fenceType is chain-link
                      fenceOnlyCost = 15*perimeter
   prompt the user to enter number of gates needed.
         Read number of gates
if  gates =1
       gateCost =150 *1
else if gates =2
     gateCost =150*2
else if gates =3
    gateCost =150*3

calculate the tax
               tax =(fenceOnlyCost +gateCost)*taxRate
calculate the total cost of the fence
          fenceTotalCost  = fenceOnlyCost + gateCost + permitFee+ tax
 Dispplay the total cost of the fence to the user.
